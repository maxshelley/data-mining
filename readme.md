### A modded hack for the Rewired State & DFID project 2013.

This is a modified version of [https://github.com/izeb/data-mining](https://github.com/izeb/data-mining) - originally written as part of 'Follow The Data: Lagos' hack.

##### Usual hack stuff.
Haven't had time to do any IE testing, if you're going to demo this, use a webkit browser (Chrome or Safari). The JS and the [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) were compiled using [Codekit](http://incident57.com/codekit/), but there's nothing fancy going on so [any compiler](http://mac.appstorm.net/roundups/internet-roundup/5-mac-apps-that-make-css-preprocessors-easier-to-use/) would work.

The JS needs tidying up (an understatement), but it gets from A to B.

The contact form is not wired up to anything (we didn't have anywhere to send it) - there are dropown lists of potential recipients in the original repo somewhere.

Not sure who owns the AddThis account in here.

If you need to contact anyone regarding the data in the hack, your best bet is to speak to the lovely people at [Rewired State](http://rewiredstate.org/).
